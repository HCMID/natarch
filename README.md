## The Declaration of Independence

What truths did Thomas Jefferson hold to be "self evident"? It might depend on your reading of the faint punctuation marks on the parchment â€” is it a period, followed by a long dash? Or just a single dash? (See [this story in the *New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/us/politics/a-period-is-questioned-in-the-declaration-of-independence.html?emc=eta1) for more on the "battle of the period.")
